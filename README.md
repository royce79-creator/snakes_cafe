# snake_cafe lab 01

**Author**: Connor Boyce
**Version**: 1.0.1 - First itereation of the assignment.

## Overview
This code base currently will show a menu of item that are for the snake cafe and will allow input from the user to order items off the menu.

## Getting Started
1. First I had to get the menu to show during the launch of python in terminal.
2. Soon after I had to come up with coding the actual fucntions that would allow for the user to input their menu items.
3. Finally there was work that was done to have the output show multile orders being shown when ordering more than one item two times or more.

## Architecture
In this I used Python, poetry shell

## Change Log
No other changes than the work that has already been done.

## Credit and Collaborations 
I have to give credit to Alex Payne since he helped with getting code logic down.
